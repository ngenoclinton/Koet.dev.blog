In the journey of modern web development, few things teach you faster than building a real-world full-stack application. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been developing a **digital plant marketplace** — a Next.js application where users can explore, upload, and purchase plant products.  

Along the way, I’ve touched nearly every    layer of the modern web stack: frontend components, backend APIs, database modeling, file uploads, and developer experience improvements. This article breaks down what I’ve learned — the wins, the bugs, and the aha moments.

## Building with Next.js and Prisma

At the heart of the project is **Next.js**, providing the structure for both the client interface and the backend API routes.  
For data persistence, I used **Prisma ORM** connected to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Neon**.  

Each plant object follows a simple but powerful structure:

```ts
const object = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  downloadUrl: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
  userId: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}
